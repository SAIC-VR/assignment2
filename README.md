## Directions
1. Accept the GitHub classroom assignment via link provided in slack.

2. On a local resource clone the newly created repository.

3. Modify the Unity project by adding shapes to the scene, to fill the matching shape and orientations.
	1. Add a cube to the scene (e.g 4.5 units scale), a rotation of 45 on Y axis
	2. Add a sphere (radius 10) to the scene, and place it in the sphere shape area
	3. Add a cylinder to the scene, and find out the right dimensions and orientation to match the cylinder area in Unity
4. Commit changes to repository, remember to add a useful commit message.
5. Push committed changes to github, I will look for commit messages in the repository.
6. Change the color of the sphere to red.
7. Add a texturemap of your choice to the cube.
8. Make the cylinder a green semitransparent color.
9. Commit changes to repository, remember to add a useful commit message. 	
10. Push committed changes to github.
